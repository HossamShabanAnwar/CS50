sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: 1- in random50000.txt it took the biggest time.
2- it almost equal the time of sort3 incase of reversed50000.txt(worst case scinario) which is O(n^2).
3- comparing between random50000.txt and sorted50000.txt time you can see how difference it make to be dealing
with a sorted list which is really important for Bubble algorithm.

sort2 uses: Merged sort

How do you know?: 1- Least time in reversed50000.txt(worst case scinario) because it's in the least order among
the two other algorithms O(nlogn).
2- comparing between random50000.txt and sorted50000.txt time you can see how similar their time is indicating that sorted
or not it doesn't really matter for that algorithm.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: 1- simply cause I'm sure of the other two.
2- comparing between sorted50000.txt time for all three algorithms you can see how sort3 takes the most time even if the
list is already sorted that's because it must reach every element and check if sorted or not
